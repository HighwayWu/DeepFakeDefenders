## Motivation
The visualization of features in the official split of training and validation sets reveals two key insights: 1) the similarity in distribution between the training and validation sets makes it challenging to evaluate the model's performance on unseen test sets; 2) the feature types of fake data are richer compared to real data. This insight inspired us to initially use unsupervised clustering to partition the challenging validation set, followed by augmenting the types of real and fake data based on adversarial learning principles. These insights led to the development of our proposed generalizable deepfake detection method.

## Framework
The framework of our proposed method consists of two primary stages: Data Preparing and Training. In the Data Preparing stage, we focus on augmenting the existing dataset by generating new data through image editing and Stable Diffusion (SD) techniques. We then perform clustering to reassemble the dataset, aiming to enhance both the detection performance and the robustness of our method. In the Training stage, we introduce a series of expert models and optimize them using three types of losses: $L_{\mathsf{KL}}$, $L_{\mathsf{NCE}}$, and $L_{\mathsf{CE}}$. This multi-loss approach ensures that the model can effectively differentiate between authentic and manipulated images. Please refer to the tech report (will be on arXiv later) for more details.

## Inference

- For testing:
```bash
>> python infer.py
```
Enter the image path and expect the following result:
```bash
>> demo/img_1_should_be_0.0016829653177410.jpg
>> Predicion of [img_1_should_be_0.0016829653177410.jpg] being Deepfake: 0.001683078
```
